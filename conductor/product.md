# Initial Concept
A platform named "persona-chat" where AI personas with unique identities and perspectives engage in human-like debates.

# Product Guide: Persona Chat

## Vision
Persona Chat is an interactive platform where unique AI personas, each with distinct backgrounds and perspectives, engage in autonomous debates. By leveraging multi-model orchestration, the platform provides a space for educational exploration, entertainment, and the comparative evaluation of different LLMs.

## Target Users
*   **Researchers and Students:** Individuals studying AI behavior, multi-agent interaction, and emergent properties of collaborative LLMs.
*   **Content Creators:** Users looking for unique, AI-generated dialogue or structured debate scenarios for creative projects.
*   **Casual Users:** Curious explorers interested in viewing complex topics through the lens of diverse AI perspectives.

## Core Features
*   **Custom Persona Creation:** Deep configuration for AI agents, including names, detailed bios, and specific personality traits to ensure unique "human-like" identities.
*   **Automated Debate Mode:** A system that facilitates hands-free interaction between multiple personas based on a user-defined topic.
*   **Multi-Provider Integration:** Native support for various LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic), allowing users to assign different models to different personas within the same debate.

## Interaction Model
*   **Autonomous Flow:** A dynamic turn-taking system where personas determine when it is appropriate to speak based on the preceding context, rather than following a rigid sequence.
*   **Model Comparison:** A focus on evaluating how different model architectures (and their specific tunings) interpret and maintain persona identities during prolonged discussions.

## Success Metrics
*   **Persona Fidelity:** The degree to which AI agents maintain their defined personalities and backgrounds throughout a debate.
*   **Contextual Relevance:** How effectively the autonomous flow keeps the conversation centered on the user's chosen topic while allowing for natural tangents.

# Product Guidelines: Persona Chat

## Visual Identity & Aesthetic
Persona Chat employs a **Modern Academic-Tech** hybrid aesthetic. The interface is clean and minimalist, prioritizing readability and data clarity, while maintaining a futuristic feel through dark-themed elements and precise UI components. The overall mood is professional yet approachable, ensuring that the technology feels advanced but not intimidating.

## Voice and Tone
The application's copy is **Neutral and Objective**. We avoid hyperbolic claims about AI, focusing instead on accuracy and clear, functional instructions. The goal is to provide a stable, unbiased framework that allows the diverse personalities of the AI agents to be the primary focus of the experience.

## Design Principles
*   **Clarity over Clutter:** The debate interface is designed for maximum legibility. Distractions are minimized to ensure users can follow complex, multi-persona arguments with ease.
*   **Real-time Responsiveness:** The UI provides immediate feedback as the autonomous debate unfolds, using subtle animations and clear state indicators to represent speaker transitions.
*   **Structured Information Density:** For researchers and power users, essential metadata (e.g., interaction timestamps, persona identifiers) is integrated seamlessly without compromising the primary reading experience.

## Persona Representation
*   **Text-Centric Identity:** To avoid the "uncanny valley" and keep the focus on intellectual exchange, personas are primarily identified through their unique names and distinctive prose styles. 
*   **Seamless Integration:** Underlying technical details (such as the specific LLM model or provider) are treated as implementation details and are kept secondary to the persona's identity to maintain the immersion of the debate.

## User Experience (UX) Goals
*   **Immersion:** Ensure the user feels like they are observing a genuine exchange between distinct entities.
*   **Control:** Provide intuitive ways for users to define the parameters (topic, participants) while allowing the AI to drive the conversation autonomously once started.
